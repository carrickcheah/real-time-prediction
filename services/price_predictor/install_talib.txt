Hi Bro! I faced the same issue before, here’s how I solved it. Hope if it can works for you.

Step 1: Switch to Git Bash
If you’re using PowerShell in your terminal (default in Windows), switch to Git Bash. I had multiple issues with PowerShell, but everything worked smoothly once I switched to Git Bash.

Step 2: Download the `TA-Lib` Wheel File
1. Visit the following links to download the appropriate `TA-Lib` file for your Windows version:
   - [TA-Lib Release Files](https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/releases)

Download ur Windows version, and save the file in price_predictor folder.


Step 3: Install with Poetry
poetry add c:ur_file_path_ur_python_version. (ur python is 3.11,change cp310 to 311)
In your terminal, use one of these commands (choose the one that matches your file path format):
Either 1:
```bash
poetry add C:\\Users\\roy12\\src\\real-time-ml-system-20241026\\services\\price_predictor\\TA_Lib-0.4.32-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
poetry add "C:\Users\roy12\src\real-time-ml-system-20241026\services\price_predictor\TA_Lib-0.4.32-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl"
poetry add C:/Users/roy12/src/real-time-ml-system-20241026/services/price_predictor/TA_Lib-0.4.32-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

Step 4:
Done and Check Version
$ python -c "import talib; print(talib.__version__)"
